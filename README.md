# hello-word
This is my first repository

The tutorial told me to write a little bit about myself but I don't think that is really appropriate for this moment so what I'm going to do is tell you what I've been listening to. Btw, I'm sorry for my poor English writing, I'm better talking.

Today I listened to XXX TENTATION (I KNOW, OKAY?), 6LACK, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Led Zeppelin. My music taste changes with my mood.

This is just an add from my desktop.
